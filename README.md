#####Functionality and How it works

1. Any employee in a company can propose any idea to help shape the business and stratey of the company
2. The form asks the user to submit a title, blurb, reason, goal, and implementation and budget as well as a document to support his or her idea
3. The form is displayed in the ideas dashboard
4. A comment box enables all employees to discuss the idea
5. All employees can only vote once for an idea 
6. The percentage of votes in favour of an idea will be displayed in a pie chart
7. The 5 most popular ideas in a company will be displayed in the ideas dashboard above all ideas generated by the employees of a specific company


####The build

1. Ruby on Rails Application
2. The following Ruby gems were used:
    - Cancancan to limit the ability of users to see other users and other companies and ideas unless they were signed up to it
    - Act_as_commentable to enable users to comment on the ideas of colleagues
    - Act_as_votable to enable users to vote for an idea generated by their colleagues 
    - Devise was installed in conjunction with Ruby on Rails to generate the application
    - Foundation was installed to add styling including grids, and navigation bars
3. Foundation for styling and custom CSS were foundation was not applicable to use
4. HTML5 as HTML (Rails) erb files
5. JavaScript was used in conjunction with Ruby and Google charts to produce a pie chart by installing the gem Chartkick  
6. The Google web font 'Quicksand' has been used for the styling 


#### Problems & Challenges

The main challenge I faced building this application was to implement Ruby gems. CanCanCan created a number of problems when limiting the access of users from a specific company to vist the profiles of other users from a different company. Eventually, I decided to remove company pages and insert companies in my seed data. 


Another challenge I faced was integrating the chart to reflect the number of votes made. In order to make a link between the upvotes and the chart, I had to write some methods.   

Minor mistakes also cost me a lot of time.
